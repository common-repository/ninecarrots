== Description ==

NineCarrots embeds the local business mapping system in to your WordPress system.
Note that the data on the map and the management of the map is all hosted by 9carrots.org, not your WordPress database.
We are a not-for-profit and centrally store the information only so that everyone can share ideas and data.

Features

PS: You should create your local community group on 9carrots.org first to centre the map properly and hold all your businesses
